# Tweeter Project

Tweeter üê¶ is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. The front-end was built during my 4th week at [Lighthouse Labs]('https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/')

This project was created to practice my HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills.

## SASS Script <a name='script'></a>

To make changes to any of the SASS code and retranspile it. First make sure you have SASS installed. Here is a link to the [sass website]('https://www.sass-lang.com/install') that explains how to do it at length. Or just run the command below after its installed.

```bash
  npm i -g sass
```

Once its installed go to the root directory and run

```bash
  npm sass-watch
```

This will transpile all of the sass changes that are made on the spot
